 Example for using oidc_flask with
IAM of the [Deep Hybrid Datacloud](https://deep-hybrid-datacloud.eu)
project.

The example covers web access control as well as API access control

For using the API you will need a valid OIDC access token. For the
commandline you might want to use
[oidc-agent](https://github.com/indigo-dc/oidc-agent) for that .
